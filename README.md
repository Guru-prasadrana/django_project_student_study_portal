# django_project_student_study_portal
The project aims to ease the work of students. 
Instead of visiting several sites, 'The Study Portal' 
is a one-stop solution for it. Containing several 
features and a user-friendly UI
• The student portal can bring all the tabs to a single 
site. From a to-do list to getting youtube videos and 
making notes, everything will be saved in one 
place. With a fully flexible authentication system.
